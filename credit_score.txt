Topic: What is a Credit Score and Why Does It Matter?

A credit score is a number, typically between 300 and 900, that represents your creditworthiness. It tells lenders how reliable you are at paying back borrowed money. The higher your score, the better.

Your credit score is calculated based on several factors, including:
Your payment history (do you pay your bills on time?)
How much debt you have
The length of your credit history

The types of credit you use (credit cards, loans, etc.)
A high credit score is incredibly valuable. It makes it easier to get approved for new loans and credit cards, and most importantly, it qualifies you for lower interest rates. A higher score can save you tens of thousands or even lakhs of rupees over the lifetime of a large loan like a home or car loan.
