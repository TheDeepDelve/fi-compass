Topic: What is APR (Annual Percentage Rate)?

APR, or Annual Percentage Rate, is the total yearly cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. It includes the interest rate plus any other fees associated with a loan or credit card.

For a credit card, the APR is the interest you are charged on any balance you don't pay off by the due date. A high APR means that carrying debt becomes very expensive, very quickly. For example, a 36% APR means you are being charged roughly 3% of your outstanding balance every single month.

This is why it's so important to pay off high-APR debt as quickly as possible. Every rupee you put towards paying it down not only reduces your debt but also saves you a significant amount in future interest payments, freeing up your money for your own financial goals.
