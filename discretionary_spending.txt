Topic: What is Discretionary Spending? (The "Latte Factor")

Discretionary spending is money you spend on things you want rather than things you absolutely need. Needs are things like rent, utilities, and essential groceries. Wants are things like dining out, entertainment subscriptions, daily coffee shop visits, and shopping for non-essentials.

This is sometimes called the "Latte Factor." A single ₹200 coffee doesn't seem like much, but if you buy one every workday, that's ₹4,000 a month or ₹48,000 a year. These small, frequent purchases can add up to a significant amount that could have been used to pay off debt or be invested towards a major life goal, like a down payment on a house.

Identifying and reducing your discretionary spending is one of the fastest and most direct ways to increase your savings rate and accelerate your journey to your financial goals.
