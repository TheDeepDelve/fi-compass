I thought then that it was by far the best book about investing ever written. I still think it is. To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a strato- spheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information.Whats needed is a sound intellectual framework for making deci- sions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that frame- work. This book precisely and clearly prescribes the properframework. You must supply the emotional discipline. If you follow the behavioral and business principles that Gra- ham advocatesand if you pay special attention to the invaluableadvice in Chapters 8 and 20you will not get a poor result from your investments",

Whether you achieve outstanding resultswill depend on the effort and intellect you apply to your invest-ments, as well as on the amplitudes of stock-market folly that pre-vail during your investing career. The sillier the markets behavior,the greater the opportunity for the business-like investor. Follow Graham and you will profit from folly rather than participate in it. To me, Ben Graham was far more than an author or a teacher. More than any other man except my father, he influenced my life.Shortly after Bens death in 1976, I wrote the following short remembrance about him in the Financial Analysts Journal.

      "text": "ix Preface to the Fourth Edition BENJAMIN GRAHAM 18941976 Several years ago Ben Graham, then almost eighty, expressed to a friend the thought that he hoped every day to do something foolish, something creative and something generous. The inclusion of that first whimsical goal reflected his knack for pack- aging ideas in a form that avoided any overtones of sermonizing or self-importance. Although his ideas were powerful, their delivery was unfailingly gentle. Readers of this magazine need no elaboration of his achievements as measured by the standard of creativity. It is rare that the founder of a disci- pline does not find his work eclipsed in rather short order by successors. But over forty years after publication of the book that brought structure and logic to a disorderly and confused activity, it is difficult to think of pos-sible candidates for even the runner-up position in the field of securityanalysis",

In an area where much looks foolish within weeks or months after publication, Bens principles have remained soundtheir value often enhanced and better understood in the wake of financial storms thatdemolished flimsier intellectual structures. His counsel of soundnessbrought unfailing rewards to his followerseven to those with natural abilities inferior to more gifted practitioners who stumbled while follow- ing counsels of brilliance or fashion. A remarkable aspect of Bens dominance of his professional field was that he achieved it without that narrowness of mental activity that concen- trates all effort on a single end. It was, rather, the incidental by-product of an intellect whose breadth almost exceeded definition. Certainly I havenever met anyone with a mind of similar scope. Virtually total recall,unending fascination with new knowledge, and an ability to recast it in a form applicable to seemingly unrelated problems made exposure to his thinking in any field a delight",

In each relationshipjust as with all his students, employees, and friendsthere was an absolutely open-ended, no-scores-kept generosity of ideas, time,and spirit. If clarity of thinking was required, there was no better place togo. And if encouragement or counsel was needed, Ben was there.

Graham was not only one of the best investors who ever lived; he was also the greatest practical investment thinker of all time. Before Graham, money managers behaved much like a medieval guild, guided largely bysuperstition, guesswork, and arcane rituals. Grahams Security Analysis was the textbook that transformed this musty circle into a modern pro- fession. 1 AndThe Intelligent Investor is the first book ever to describe, for individual investors, the emotional framework and analytical tools that are essential to financial success. It remains the single best book on investing ever written for the general public. The Intelligent Investor was the first book I read when I joined Forbes Magazine as a cub reporter in 1987 , and I was struck by Grahams certainty that, sooneror later, all bull markets must end badly.

(Today,after the wild bull market of the late 1990s and the brutal bear market that began in early 2000, The Intelligent Investor reads more prophet- ically than ever.) Graham came by his insights the hard way: by feeling firsthand the anguish of financial loss and by studying for decades the history and psychology of the markets. He was born Benjamin Grossbaum onMay 9, 1894, in London; his father was a dealer in china dishes and figurines. 2The family moved to New York when Ben was a year old.

For the rest of his life, Ben would recall the humiliation of cashing a check for his mother and hearing the bank teller ask, IsDorothy Grossbaum good for five dollars? Fortunately, Graham won a scholarship at Columbia, where his brilliance burst into full flower. He graduated in 1914, second in hisclass. Before the end of Grahams final semester, three departments English, philosophy, and mathematicsasked him to join the faculty.He was all of 20 years old.

Combining his extraordinary intellectual powers with profound common sense and vast experience, Graham developed his core principles, which are at least as valid today as theywere during his lifetime:  A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value that does not depend on its share price.  The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustain- able optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustifiedpessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investoris a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.  The future value of every investment is a function of its present price.

But, as an aside, we should remark that the return actually realized by the 20-year operationwould have been better than 8 compounded annuallyand thisdespite the fact that the investor would have begun his purchaseswith the DJIA at 300 and ended with a valuation based on the 1948closing level of 177. This record may be regarded as a persuasive argument for the principle of regular monthly purchases of strong common stocks through thick and thina program known as dollar-cost averaging. Since our book is not addressed to speculators, it is not meant for those who trade in the market. Most of these people are guidedby charts or other largely mechanical means of determining the right moments to buy and sell. The one principle that applies to nearly all these so-called technical approaches is that one shouldbuy because a stock or the market has gone up and one should sell because it has declined",

Henry David Thoreau, Walden Notice that Graham announces from the start that this book will not tell you how to beat the market. No truthful book can. Instead, this book will teach you three powerful lessons:  how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses; how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains; how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps most investors from reaching their full potential. Back in the boom years of the late 1990s, when technology stocks seemed to be doubling in value every day, the notion that you couldlose almost all your money seemed absurd. But, by the end of 2002,many of the dot-com and telecom stocks had lost 95 of their value or more. Once you lose 95 of your money, you have to gain 1,900 just to get back to where you started",

Now lets answer a vitally important question. What exactly does Gra- ham mean by an intelligent investor? Back in the first edition of thisbook, Graham defines the termand he makes it clear that this kind ofintelligence has nothing to do with IQ or SAT scores. It simply meansbeing patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able to harness your emotions and think for yourself. This kind of intelligence, explains Graham, is a trait more of the character than of the brain.  2 Theres proof that high IQ and higher education are not enough to make an investor intelligent. In 1998, Long-Term Capital ManagementL.P., a hedge fund run by a battalion of mathematicians, computer scientists, and two Nobel Prizewinning economists, lost more than 2 billion in a matter of weeks on a huge bet that the bond marketwould return to normal",

Sensing that the market was getting out of hand, the great physicist muttered thathe could calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of the people.  Newton dumped his South Sea shares, pock- eting a 100 profit totaling 7 ,000. But just months later, swept up inthe wild enthusiasm of the market, Newton jumped back in at a much higher priceand lost 20,000 (or more than 3 million in todays money).

The intelligent investor realizes that stocks become more risky,not less, as their prices riseand less risky, not more, as their prices fall. The intelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it makes stocksmore costly to buy. And conversely (so long as you keep enough cash on hand to meet your spending needs), you should welcome a bear market, since it puts stocks back on sale. 8 So take heart: The death of the bull market is not the bad news everyone believes it to be.

Think of our suggested definition of investment given above, and compare it with the sale of a few shares of stock by aninexperienced member of the public, who does not even own whathe is selling, and has some largely emotional conviction that hewill be able to buy them back at a much lower price.

What We Said Six Years Ago We recommended that the investor divide his holdings between high-grade bonds and leading common stocks; that the proportion held in bonds be never less than 25 or more than 75, with theconverse being necessarily true for the common-stock component;that his simplest choice would be to maintain a 5050 proportionbetween the two, with adjustments to restore the equality whenmarket developments had disturbed it by as much as, say, 5. Asan alternative policy he might choose to reduce his common-stock component to 25 if he felt the market was dangerously high, and conversely to advance it toward the maximum of 75 if hefelt that a decline in stock prices was making them increasingly attractive. In 1965 the investor could obtain about 4 12 on high-grade tax- able bonds and 314 on good tax-free bonds. The dividend return on leading common stocks (with the DJIA at 892) was only about3.2.

Hence, after this foreshortened discussion of the major consider- ations, we once again enunciate the same basic compromise policy26 The Intelligent Investor  Since 1997 , when Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or TIPS) were introduced, stocks have no longer been the automatically superior choice for investors who expect inflation to increase. TIPS, unlike other bonds, rise in value if the Consumer Price Index goes up, effectively immunizing theinvestor against losing money after inflation. Stocks carry no such guaranteeand, in fact, are a relatively poor hedge against high rates of inflation. (Formore details, see the commentary to Chapter 2.) www.fx1618.com",

Since at present the overall return envisaged from common stocks is nearly the same as that from bonds, the presently expectablereturn (including growth of stock values) for the investor wouldchange little regardless of how he divides his fund between the two components. As calculated above, the aggregate return from both parts should be about 7.8 before taxes or 5.5 on a tax-free(or estimated tax-paid) basis.

The first is the purchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as analternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio. He mightalso utilize one of the common trust funds, or commingled funds, operated by trust companies and banks in many states; or, if his funds are substantial, use the services of a recognized invest-ment-counsel firm.

Blaise Pascal Why do you suppose the brokers on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange always cheer at the sound of the closing bellno matter what the market did that day? Because whenever you trade, they make moneywhether you did or not. By speculating instead of invest- ing, you lower your own odds of building wealth and raise someone elses. Grahams definition of investing could not be clearer: An invest- ment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safetyof principal and an adequate return.  1Note that investing, according to Graham, consists equally of three elements:  you must thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of its underlying businesses, before you buy its stock;  you must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses;  you must aspire to adequate,  not extraordinary, performance",

People who invest make money for themselves; people who speculate make money for their brokers. And that, in turn, is why Wall Street perennially downplays the durablevirtues of investing and hypes the gaudy appeal of speculation. UNSAFE AT HIGH SPEED Confusing speculation with investment, Graham warns, is always a mistake. In the 1990s, that confusion led to mass destruction.

After all, if it were this easy, surely everyone would hear about it, lots of people would do it, and the opportunity would wither away. What caused the January jolt?

The shrinkage in the purchasing power of the dollar in the past, and particularly the fear (or hopeby speculators) of a serious further decline in the future, hasgreatly influenced the thinking of Wall Street. It is clear that those with a fixed dollar income will suffer when the cost of living advances, and the same applies to a fixed amount of dollar princi-pal. Holders of stocks, on the other hand, have the possibility that a loss of the dollars purchasing power may be offset by advances in their dividends and the prices of their shares. On the basis of these undeniable facts many financial authorities have concluded that (1) bonds are an inherently undesirable formof investment, and (2) consequently, common stocks are by theirvery nature more desirable investments than bonds",

But both stock earnings and stock prices as a whole have declined since 1965. There are similar contradictions in both directions in therecord of previous five-year periods.

The cold figures demonstrate that allthe large gain in the earnings of the DJIA unit in the past 20 years was due to a proportionatelylarge growth of invested capital coming from reinvested profits. If inflation had operated as a separate favorable factor, its effectwould have been to increase the value of previously existing capital; this in turn should increase the rate of earnings on such old capital and therefore on the old and new capital combined. Butnothing of the kind actually happened in the past 20 years, during which the wholesale price level has advanced nearly 40.

Since 1960, 69 of the worlds market-oriented countries have suffered at least one year in which inflation ran at an annualizedrate of 25 or more. On average, those inflationary periods destroyed 53 of an investors purchasing power. 5We would be crazy not to hope that America is somehow exempt from such adisaster. But we would be even crazier to conclude that it cannever happen here. 6  Rising prices allow Uncle Sam to pay off his debts with dollars that have been cheapened by inflation.

During the American Revolution, prices roughly tripled every year from 1777 through1779, with a pound of butter costing 12 and a barrel of flour fetching nearly 1,600 in Revolutionary Massachusetts. During the Civil War, infla-tion raged at annual rates of 29 (in the North) and nearly 200 (in the Confederacy). As recently as 1946, inflation hit 18.1 in the United States",

The best choice is Van- guard REIT Index Fund; other relatively low-cost choices include Cohen  Steers Realty Shares, Columbia Real Estate Equity Fund, and Fidelity Real Estate Investment Fund.11While a REIT fund is unlikely to be a foolproof inflation-fighter, in the long run it should giveyou some defense against the erosion of purchasing power without hampering your overall returns.

Only two of the nine decades after thefirst show a decrease in earnings and average prices (in 18911900and 19311940), and no decade after 1900 shows a decrease in aver- age dividends",

The rate of profiton invested capital fell to the lowest percentage since the World War years. Equally striking is the fact that a considerable number of companies reported net losses for the year; many became finan-cially troubled, and for the first time in three decades there were quite a few important bankruptcy proceedings.

In June 1949 the S  P compositeindex sold at only 6.3 times the applicable earnings of the past 12 months; in March 1961 the ratio was 22.9 times. Similarly, the divi- dend yield on the S  P index had fallen from over 7 in 1949 toonly 3.0 in 1961, a contrast heightened by the fact that interest rates on high-grade bonds had meanwhile risen from 2.60 to 4.50. This is certainly the most remarkable turnabout in thepublics attitude in all stock-market history. To people of long experience and innate caution the passage from one extreme to another carried a strong warning of trou-ble ahead.

When we approached this problem in 1953 the average market level for thatyear had reached 275, a gain of over 50 in five years.

The first was that old standards (of valuation) appear inapplicable; new standards have not yet been tested by time. The second was that the investor must base his policy on the existence of major uncertainties. The possibilities compass the extremes, on the one hand, of a protracted and further advance in the markets levelsay by 50, or to 1350 for the DJIA; or, on theother hand, of a largely unheralded collapse of the same magni- tude, bringing the average in the neighborhood of, say, 450\" (p. 63).

We suggest, however, that if the investor is in doubt as towhich course to pursue he should choose the path of caution. The principles of investment, as set forth herein, would call for the fol- lowing policy under 1964 conditions, in order of urgency: 1. No borrowing to buy or hold securities.2.

This time we can say that our caution was vindicated. The DJIA advanced about 11 further, to 995, but then fell irregularly to a low of 632 in 1970, and finished that year at 839.

When dividend yields are compared with bond yields we find that the relationship was completely reversed between 1948 and 1972. Inthe early year stocks yielded twice as much as bonds; now bonds yield twice as much, and more, than stocks.

In terms of historical market swings the 1971 picture would still appear to be one of irregular recovery from the bad setback suf-fered in 19691970. In the past such recoveries have ushered in anew stage of the recurrent and persistent bull market that began in 1949. (This was the expectation of Wall Street generally during 1971.) After the terrible experience suffered by the public buyers oflow-grade common-stock offerings in the 19681970 cycle, it is too early (in 1971) for another twirl of the new-issue merry-go-round.Hence that dependable sign of imminent danger in the market is lacking now, as it was at the 892 level of the DJIA in November 1964, considered in our previous edition",

Most went bankrupt, and their investorslost their knickers. But the stock indexes ignore all the companies that went bust in those early years, a problem technically known as sur-vivorship bias.

When every investor comes to believe that stocks are guaranteed to make money in the long run, wont the market end up being wildly overpriced? And once that happens, how can futurereturns possibly be high? Grahams answers, as always, are rooted in logic and common sense. The value of any investment is, and always must be, a functionof the price you pay for it. By the late 1990s, inflation was witheringaway, corporate profits appeared to be booming, and most of theworld was at peace.

OnMarch 24, 2000, the total value of the U.S. stock market peaked at14.75 trillion. By October 9, 2002, just 30 months later, the total U.S. stock market was worth 7 .34 trillion, or 50.2 lessa loss of 7 .41 trillion. Meanwhile, many market pundits turned sourly bear- ish, predicting flat or even negative market returns for yearsevendecadesto come.

I think Graham,ever the conservative, would split the difference between the lowestand highest past returns and project that over the next decade stocks will earn roughly 6 annually, or 4 after inflation. (Interestingly, thatprojection matches the estimate we got earlier when we added together real growth, inflationary growth, and speculative growth.) Compared to the 1990s, 6 is chicken feed. But its a whisker betterthan the gains that bonds are likely to produceand reason enough for most investors to hang on to stocks as part of a diversified portfolio.

At one extreme we have had savings banks, life-insurancecompanies, and so-called legal trust funds.

At the other extreme we have the well-to-do and experienced businessman,who will include any kind of bond or stock in his security list pro- vided he considers it an attractive purchase. It has been an old and sound principle that those who cannot afford to take risks should be content with a relatively low returnon their invested funds.

There are two ways to be an intelligent investor:  by continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds;  or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement). Graham calls the first approach active or enterprising; it takes lots of time and loads of energy. The passive or defensive strategy takes little time or effort but requires an almost ascetic detachment from the alluring hullabaloo of the market.

That sets his advice firmly against the winds of con- ventional wisdomwhich holds that how much investing risk you oughtto take depends mainly on how old you are. 2A traditional rule of thumb was to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of yourassets in stocks, with the rest in bonds or cash.

But when you watch everydollar you invested getting bashed down to a dime, its hard to resist bailing out into the safety of bonds and cash. Instead of buying and holding their stocks, many people end up buying high, selling low, andholding nothing but their own head in their hands.

Far from being an afterthought, dividends are the greatest force in stock investing. Why do the high prices of stocks affect their dividend yields? A stocks yield is the ratio of its cash dividend to the price of one share of common stock. If a company pays a 2 annual dividend when its stock price is 100per share, its yield is 2.

It seems tome that this apparent objection has lost much of its force in recent years. Common stocks are becoming generally accepted as a neces- sary component of a sound savings-investment program",

Let us return to this matter, in the light of our subsequent discussion of general policy. To whatextent should the type of securities selected by the investor varywith his circumstances? As concrete examples representing widely different conditions, we shall take: (1) a widow left 200,000 withwhich to support herself and her children; (2) a successful doctor in mid-career, with savings of 100,000 and yearly accretions of 10,000; and (3) a young man earning 200 per week and saving1,000 a year. For the widow, the problem of living on her income is a very dif- ficult one. On the other hand the need for conservatism in herinvestments is paramount. A division of her fund about equally between United States bonds and first-grade common stocks is a compromise between these objectives and corresponds to our gen-eral prescription for the defensive investor",

We do not preclude the possibility that the widow may qualify as an enterprising investor, in which case her objectives and meth- ods will be quite different. The one thing the widow must notdo is to take speculative chances in order to make some extra income. By this we mean trying for profits or high income without the nec-essary equipment to warrant full confidence in overall success. Itwould be far better for her to draw 2,000 per year out of her prin-cipal, in order to make both ends meet, than to risk half of it in poorly grounded, and therefore speculative, ventures.

Note on the Concept of Risk It is conventional to speak of good bonds as less risky than good preferred stocks and of the latter as less risky than good commonstocks. From this was derived the popular prejudice against com-mon stocks because they are not safe, which was demonstratedin the Federal Reserve Boards survey of 1948. We should like topoint out that the words risk and safety are applied to securi-ties in two different senses, with a resultant confusion in thought. A bond is clearly proved unsafe when it defaults its interest or principal payments. Similarly, if a preferred stock or even a com-mon stock is bought with the expectation that a given rate of divi-dend will be continued, then a reduction or passing of the dividend means that it has proved unsafe",

Nevertheless, the idea of risk is often extended to apply to a pos- sible decline in the price of a security, even though the decline maybe of a cyclical and temporary nature and even though the holder is unlikely to be forced to sell at such times. These chances are pres- ent in all securities, other than United States savings bonds, and toa greater extent in the general run of common stocks than in senior issues as a class. But we believe that what is here involved is not a true risk in the useful sense of the term. The man who holds amortgage on a building might have to take a substantial loss if he were forced to sell it at an unfavorable time. That element is not taken into account in judging the safety or risk of ordinary real-estate mortgages, the only criterion being the certainty of punctual payments",

Something should be said now about investing in second-grade issues, which can readily be found to yield any specified return up to 8 or more. The main difference between first- and second-grade bonds is usually found in the number of times the interest charges have been covered by earnings. Example: In early 1964 Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific 5 income debenturebonds, at 68, yielded 7.35. But the total interest charges of the road, before income taxes, were earned only 1.5 times in 1963, against our requirement of 5 times for a well-protected railroadissue. 1 Many investors buy securities of this kind because they need income and cannot get along with the meager return offered by top-grade issues.

Finally, most of the high returns on IPOs are captured by members of an exclusive private clubthe big investment banksand fund houses that get shares at the initial (or underwriting) price,before the stock begins public trading. The biggest run-ups oftenoccur in stocks so small that even many big investors cant get any shares; there just arent enough to go around. If, like nearly every investor, you can get access to IPOs only after their shares have rocketed above the exclusive initial price, yourresults will be terrible.

(2) Taxable but high-yielding New Community bonds, also guar- anteed by the United States government.

This relies largelyon estimating future earnings and then multiplying these by a fac- tor appropriate to the particular issue. If the resultant value is suffi- ciently above the market priceand if the investor has confidencein the technique employedhe can tag the stock as a bargain. The second test is the value of the business to a private owner. This value also is often determined chiefly by expected future earn-ingsin which case the result may be identical with the first.

When interest rates were much lower than in 1970, the field of bargain issues extended to bonds and preferred stocks that sold atlarge discounts from the amount of their claim.

Byfull prices we mean prices close to par for bonds or preferredstocks, and prices that represent about the fair business value ofthe enterprise in the case of common stocks.

The most troublesome consequence of our policy of exclusion is in the field of secondary common stocks. If the majority ofinvestors, being in the defensive class, are not to buy them at all, the field of possible buyers becomes seriously restricted.

They reach and even surpass that value at times;but this occurs in the upper reaches of bull markets, when the les-sons of practical experience would argue against the soundness of paying the prevailing prices for common stocks.

The many common stocks in the boundary area mayproperly exhibit an intermediate price behavior.

In February 2000, chief execu-tive John Roth of Nortel Networks was asked how much biggerhis giant fiber-optics company could get. The industry is grow-ing 14 to 15 a year,  Roth replied, and were going to grow six points faster than that. For a company our size, thats pretty heady stuff.  Nortels stock, up nearly 51 annually over the pre-vious six years, was then trading at 87 times what Wall Street was guessing it might earn in 2000. Was the stock overpriced? Its getting up there,  shrugged Roth, but theres still plenty ofroom to grow our valuation as we execute on the wireless strat- egy.  (After all, he added, Cisco Systems was trading at 121times its projected earnings!) 1 As for Cisco, in November 2000, its chief executive, John Chambers, insisted that his company could keep growing atleast 50 annually",

Ciscos stock had come way downit was thentrading at a mere 98 times its earnings over the previous year and Chambers urged investors to buy. So who you going to bet on? he asked. Now may be the opportunity.  2 Instead, these growth companies shrankand their over- priced stocks shriveled. Nortels revenues fell by 37 in 2001, and the company lost more than 26 billion that year. Ciscos revenues did rise by 18 in 2001, but the company ended upwith a net loss of more than 1 billion. Nortels stock, at113.50 when Roth spoke, finished 2002 at 1.65. Ciscosshares, at 52 when Chambers called his company a break-away,  crumbled to 13. Both companies have since become more circumspect about forecasting the future. 1Lisa Gibbs, Optic Uptick,  Money, April, 2000, pp. 5455. 2Brooke Southall, Ciscos Endgame Strategy,  InvestmentNews, November 30, 2000, pp. 1, 23. www.fx1618.com",

(The popularity of something like the Dow theory may seem to cre- ate its own vindication, since it would make the market advance ordecline by the very action of its followers when a buying or selling signal is given. A stampede of this kind is, of course, much more of a danger than an advantage to the public trader.)

The fluctuations of the market over a period of many years prior to1950 lent considerable encouragement to that idea. In fact, a classicdefinition of a shrewd investor was one who bought in a bearmarket when everyone else was selling, and sold out in a bull mar- ket when everyone else was buying. If we examine our Chart I, covering the fluctuations of the Standard  Poors composite indexbetween 1900 and 1970, and the supporting figures in Table 3-1 (p. 66), we can readily see why this viewpoint appeared valid until fairly recent years. Between 1897 and 1949 there were ten complete market cycles, running from bear-market low to bull-market high and back tobear-market low. Six of these took no longer than four years, fourran for six or seven years, and onethe famous new-era cycle of 19211932lasted eleven years",

Thus to the student ofstock-market history it appeared that the intelligent investorshould have been able to identify the recurrent bear and bull mar-kets, to buy in the former and sell in the latter, and to do so for the most part at reasonably short intervals of time.

XII, no. 3, September, 1957 , pp. 348363, which compares investing in high-priced growth stocks to betting on a series ofcoin flips in which the payoff escalates with each flip of the coin. Durand points out that if a growth stock could continue to grow at a high rate for an indefinite period of time, an investor should (in theory) be willing to payan infinite price for its shares. Why, then, has no stock ever sold for a price of infinity dollars per share? Because the higher the assumed future growth rate, and the longer the time period over which it is expected, thewider the margin for error grows, and the higher the cost of even a tiny mis-calculation becomes. Graham discusses this problem further in Appendix 4(p. 570). www.fx1618.com",

A caution is needed here. A stock does not become a sound investment merely because it can be bought at close to its assetvalue. The investor should demand, in addition, a satisfactory ratio of earnings to price, a sufficiently strong financial position, and the prospect that its earnings will at least be maintained over the years.This may appear like demanding a lot from a modestly priced stock, but the prescription is not hard to fill under all but danger- ously high market conditions.

Thus the existence of a quoted market gives the investor certain options that he does not have if his security is unquoted.

This statement may sound like a truism, but it needs to be emphasized. For as yet there is no accepted technique or approachby which management is brought to the bar of market opinion. On the contrary, managements have always insisted that they have no responsibility of any kind for what happens to the market value of their shares.

Fluctuations in Bond Prices The investor should be aware that even though safety of its prin- cipal and interest may be unquestioned, a long-term bond could vary widely in market price in response to changes in interest rates.

Note that bond prices do not fluctuate in the same (inverse) pro- portion as the calculated yields, because their fixed maturity value of 100 exerts a moderating influence.

Here are some of the handicaps mutual-fund managers and other professional investors are saddled with:  With billions of dollars under management, they must gravitate toward the biggest stocksthe only ones they can buy in the multimillion-dollar quantities they need to fill their portfolios. Thus many funds end up owning the same few overpriced giants.  Investors tend to pour more money into funds as the market rises. The managers use that new cash to buy more of the stocks theyalready own, driving prices to even more dangerous heights.  If fund investors ask for their money back when the market drops, the managers may need to sell stocks to cash them out. Just as the funds are forced to buy stocks at inflated prices in a risingmarket, they become forced sellers as stocks get cheap again",

Increasingly, fund managers are expected to specialize. Just as in medicine the general practitioner has given way to the pediatricallergist and the geriatric otolaryngologist, fund managers mustbuy only small growth stocks, or only mid-sized value stocks, or nothing but large blend stocks. 6If a company gets too big, or too small, or too cheap, or an itty bit too expensive, the fund has to sell iteven if the manager loves the stock.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows you to use your realized losses (any declines in value that you lock in by selling your shares) to offset up to 3,000 in ordinary income. 12Lets say you bought 200 shares of Coca-Cola stock in January 2000 for 60 asharea total investment of 12,000. By year-end 2002, the stockwas down to 44 a share, or 8,800 for your lota loss of 3,200. You could have done what most people doeither whine about your loss, or sweep it under the rug and pretend it never happened. Or you could have taken control. Before 2002 ended, you could have sold all your Coke shares, locking in the 3,200 loss. Then, after wait-ing 31 days to comply with IRS rules, you would buy 200 shares of Coke all over again",

And better yet, you would still own a company whose future you believe inbut now you would own it for almost one-third less than you paid the first time. 13 With Uncle Sam subsidizing your losses, it can make sense to sell and lock in a loss. If Uncle Sam wants to make Mr. Market look logicalby comparison, who are we to complain?224 Commentary on Chapter 8 12Federal tax law is subject to constant change. The example of Coca-Cola stock given here is valid under the provisions of the U.S. tax code as it stood in early 2003. 13This example assumes that the investor had no realized capital gains in 2002 and did not reinvest any Coke dividends.

Those that are redeemable on demand by the holder, at net asset value, are commonly known asmutual funds (or open-end funds). Most of these are activelyselling additional shares through a corps of salesmen. Those with nonredeemable shares are called closed-end companies or funds; the number of their shares remains relatively constant. All of thefunds of any importance are registered with the Securities  Exchange Commission (SEC), and are subject to its regulations and controls. The industry is a very large one. At the end of 1970 there were 383 funds registered with the SEC, having assets totaling 54.6 bil-lions. Of these 356 companies, with 50.6 billions, were mutualfunds, and 27 companies with 4.0 billions, were closed-end. There are different ways of classifying the funds",

The funds gain ran a little lower than S  Ps in19611965 and a little higher than S  Ps in 19661970. The third point is that a wide difference exists between the results of the indi- vidual funds.

In other words, the closed-endman could suffer a widening of 12 points in the market discount (about double) before his return would get down to that of the open-end investor. An adverse change of this magnitude has hap-pened rarely, if ever, in the history of closed-end shares. Hence it isvery unlikely that you will obtain a lower overall return from a(representative) closed-end company, bought at a discount, if itsinvestment performance is about equal to that of a representative mutual fund",

There are two problems with this argu-ment. First, it isnt true; decades of research have proven that funds with higher fees earn lower returns over time. Secondly, high returns are temporary, while high fees are nearly as permanent as granite. If you buy a fund for its hot returns, you may well end up with a handful of cold ashesbut your costs of owning the fund are almost certain notto decline when its returns do.

The great bulk of investors are ama-teurs. Naturally they feel that in choosing their securities they canprofit by professional guidance. Yet there are peculiarities inherent in the very concept of investment advice. If the reason people invest is to make money, then in seeking advice they are asking others to tell them how to make money. Thatidea has some element of naïveté. Businessmen seek professional advice on various elements of their business, but they do notexpect to be told how to make a profit. That is their own bailiwick.

Finally, the stock-brokerage industry itself has operated under favorable conditionsnamely, a huge increase in volume, fixed minimum commission rates (largely eliminating competitive fees), and a lim-ited number of member firms. The first financial troubles of the brokerage houses (in 1969) were attributed to the increase in volume itself. This, it wasclaimed, overtaxed their facilities, increased their overhead, and produced many troubles in making financial settlements. It should be pointed out this was probably the first time in history thatimportant enterprises have gone broke because they had more business than they could handle. In 1970, as brokerage failures increased, they were blamed chiefly on the falling off in volume.A strange complaint when one reflects that the turnover of the266 The Intelligent Investor  The two firms Graham had in mind were probably Du Pont, Glore, Forgan  Co. and Goodbody  Co",

Hence any recommendations made by theinvestment bankers to these customers have had to pass carefuland skeptical scrutiny.

But it is imprudent for the buyer to trust himself to the judgment of the seller. In 1959 we stated at this point: The bad results of this unsound attitude show themselves recurrently in the underwriting field and with notable effects in the sale of new common stock issues during periods of active specula-tion. Shortly thereafter this warning proved urgently needed. As already pointed out, the years 196061 and, again, 196869 were marked by an unprecedented outpouring of issues of lowest qual-ity, sold to the public at absurdly high offering prices and in many cases pushed much higher by heedless speculation and some semi-manipulation",

Then ask if they can refer you to an adviser whom they trust and who, they feel, delivers good value for his fees.

In dealing with common stocks the security analyst until recently has only rarely applied standards of value as well defined as were his standards of safety for bonds and preferred stocks.Most of the time he contended himself with a summary of past per-formances, a more or less general forecast of the futurewith par- ticular emphasis on the next 12 monthsand a rather arbitrary conclusion.

What are the chief factors entering intothe valuation of a common stock? Bond Analysis The most dependable and hence the most respectable branch of security analysis concerns itself with the safety, or quality, of bondissues and investment-grade preferred stocks. The chief criterion used for corporate bonds is the number of times that total interestcharges have been covered by available earnings for some years inthe past",

The exact standards applied will vary with different authorities. Since the tests are at bottom arbitrary, there is no way to determineprecisely the most suitable criteria. In the 1961 revision of our text-book, Security Analysis, we recommend certain coverage stan- dards, which appear in Table 11-1. Our basic test is applied only to the average results for a period of years. Other authorities require also that a minimum coverage be shown for every year considered.

But for the typical fund manager or individual investor, notdiversifying is foolish, since it is so difficult to select a limited number of stocks that will include most winners and exclude most losers. As you own more stocks, thedamage any single loser can cause will decline, and the odds of owning allthe big winners will rise. The ideal choice for most investors is a total stockmarket index fund, a low-cost way to hold every stock worth owning. www.fx1618.com",

Let us deal briefly with some of the considerations that enter into these divergent multipliers. 1.General Long-Term Prospects. No one really knows anything about what will happen in the distant future, but analysts andinvestors have strong views on the subject just the same. Theseviews are reflected in the substantial differentials between theprice/earnings ratios of individual companies and of industrygroups. At this point we added in our 1965 edition: For example, at the end of 1963 the chemical companies in the DJIA were selling at considerably higher multipliers than the oil companies, indicating stronger confidence in the prospects of the former than of the latter. Such distinctions made by the market areoften soundly based, but when dictated mainly by past perfor- mance they are as likely to be wrong as right",

Thus there is doubtless a promising area for effective work by the analyst, based on field trips, interviews with research men, and on intensive technological investigation on his own. There are hazards connected with investment conclusions derived chiefly from such glimpses into the future, and not sup- ported by presently demonstrable value. Yet there are perhapsequal hazards in sticking closely to the limits of value set by sober calculations resting on actual results. The investor cannot have it both ways. He can be imaginative and play for the big profits thatare the reward for vision proved sound by the event; but then he must run a substantial risk of major or minor miscalculation. Or he can be conservative, and refuse to pay more than a minor premiumfor possibilities as yet unproved; but in that case he must be pre- pared for the later contemplation of golden opportunities foregone",

The first is that by anticipating future losses the company escapes the necessity of allocating the losses themselves to an identifiable year. They dont belong in 1970, because they were not actually taken in that year. And theywont be shown in the year when they are actually taken, because they have already been provided for. Neat work, but might it notbe just a little misleading? The ALCOA footnote says nothing about the future tax saving from these losses. (Most other statements of this sort state specifi-cally that only the after-tax effect has been charged off.) If the ALCOA figure represents future losses before the related tax credit, then not only will future earnings be freed from the weight of thesecharges (as they are actually incurred), but they will be increased by a tax credit of some 50 thereof.

Where the growth hasbeen large the recent earnings will be well above the seven- or ten-year average, and analysts may deem these long-term figures irrel- evant. This need not be the case. The earnings can be given in terms both of the average and the latest figure. We suggest that the growth rate itself be calculated by comparing the average of the last three years with corresponding figures ten years earlier.

In other words, our past returns have been high, so lets assume that our future returns will be too.

It is one of our good-will giants, to be commented on later. A financial analyst blessed (orhandicapped) with a good memory will think of an analogybetween Emerson Electric and Zenith Radio, and that would not be reassuring. For Zenith had a brilliant growth record for manyyears; it too sold in the market for 1.7 billion (in 1966); but its prof- its fell from 43 million in 1968 to only half as much in 1970, and in that years big selloff its price declined to 22 12against the previous top of 89. High valuations entail high risks.

It often proves much more difficult to continue to grow at a high rate aftervolume and profits have already expanded to big totals. The mostsurprising aspect of Emerys story is that its earnings and marketprice continued to grow apace in 1970, which was the worst year inthe domestic air-passenger industry. This is a remarkable achieve-ment indeed, but it raises the question whether future profits maynot be vulnerable to adverse developments, through increased com-petition, pressure for new arrangements between forwarders and air- lines, etc. An elaborate study might be needed before a sound judgment could be passed on these points, but the conservativeinvestor cannot leave them out of his general reckoning.

At the close of the previous chapter we listed seven such quality and quantity criteria suggested for theselection of specific common stocks. Let us describe them in order. 1. Adequate Size of the Enterprise All our minimum figures must be arbitrary and especially in the matter of size required. Our idea is to exclude small companies which may be subject to more than average vicissitudes especiallyin the industrial field. (There are often good possibilities in suchenterprises but we do not consider them suited to the needs of thedefensive investor.) Let us use round amounts: not less than 100million of annual sales for an industrial company and, not less than 50 million of total assets for a public utility. 2",

Also, long- term debt should not exceed the net current assets (or workingcapital). For public utilities the debt should not exceed twice thestock equity (at book value). 3. Earnings Stability Some earnings for the common stock in each of the past ten years.4. Dividend Record Uninterrupted payments for at least the past 20 years. 5. Earnings Growth A minimum increase of at least one-third in per-share earnings in the past ten years using three-year averages at the beginning and end.348 The Intelligent Investor www.fx1618.com",

Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets Current price should not be more than 112times the book value last reported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb wesuggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15times earnings and 1 12times book value. It would admit an issue sell- ing at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.) General Comments: These requirements are set up especially for the needs and the temperament of defensive investors.

A considerable number of our large and formerly strongly entrenched enterprises have weakened their cur- rent ratio or overexpanded their debt, or both, in recent years. Our last two criteria are exclusive in the opposite direction, by demanding more earnings and more assets per dollar of price thanthe popular issues will supply.

Those who emphasize prediction will endeavor to anticipate fairly accurately just what the company will accomplish in futureyearsin particular whether earnings will show pronounced andpersistent growth",

Inflation and inter-est rates are undependable; economic recessions come and go at random;geopolitical upheavals like war, commodity shortages, and terrorism arrive without warning; and the fate of individual companies and their industries often turns out to be the opposite of what most investors expect. Therefore,investing on the basis of projection is a fools errand; even the forecasts of the so-called experts are less reliable than the flip of a coin. For most peo-ple, investing on the basis of protection from overpaying for a stock and from overconfidence in the quality of their own judgmentis the best solu-tion.

After all, if you could identify the next Microsoft, wouldnt it make sense for you to put all your eggs into that one basket? Well, sure. As the humorist Will Rogers once said, Dont gamble. Take all your savings and buy some good stock and hold it till it goes up, then sell it. If it dont go up, dont buy it.  However, as Rogers knew, 20/20 foresight is not a gift granted to most investors. No matter how confident we feel, theres no way to find out whether a stock will go up until after we buy it. Therefore, the stock you think is the next Micro- soft may well turn out to be the next MicroStrategy instead.

Our empha-sis in selection has been chiefly on exclusionsadvising on the one hand against all issues of recognizably poor quality, and on the other against the highest-quality issues if their price is so high as toinvolve a considerable speculative risk. In this chapter, addressed to the enterprising investor, we must consider the possibilities and the means of making individual selections which are likely to prove more profitable than an across-the-board average.

Surely, then, by the exercise of even a moderate degree of skillderived from study, experience, and native abilityit should be possible to obtain substantially better results than the DJIA. Yet there is considerable and impressive evidence to the effect that this is very hard to do, even though the qualifications of thosetrying it are of the highest.

Three such situations, among others, were current early in 1971, and they may be summarized as follows: Situation 1. Acquisition of Kayser-Roth by Bordens. In January 1971 Borden Inc. announced a plan to acquire control of Kayser-Roth (diversified apparel) by giving 1 13shares of its own stock in exchange for one share of Kayser-Roth.

Assum- ing the deal had gone through in six months, his final profit might have been at about a 40 per annum rate. Situation 2. In November 1970 National Biscuit Co. offered to buy control of Aurora Plastics Co. at 11 in cash. The stock was sell- ing at about 8 12; it closed the month at 9 and continued to sell there at year-end.

The total money values involved in these deals amounted to many, many billions. Perhapsonly a small fraction of the 5,000 announcements could have pre-sented a clear-cut opportunity for purchase of shares by a special-situations man, but this fraction was still large enough to keep himbusy studying, picking, and choosing. The other side of the picture is that an increasing proportion of the mergers announced failed to be consummated.

Late in 1971 the price fell below 20 while Borden was selling at 25,equivalent to 33 for Kayser-Roth under the terms of the exchangeoffer.

An investment may offer the best of one world, or the worst of another; but the best of both worlds seldom becomes available in a single package.

As an ominous precedent on Wall Street history, we may mention the warrants of American  For- eign Power Co., which in 1929 had a quoted market value of over a billion dollars, although they appeared only in a footnote to thecompanys balance sheet. By 1932 this billion dollars had shrunk to 8 million, and in 1952 the warrants were wiped out in the companys recapitalizationeven though it had remained solvent. Originally, stock-option warrants were attached now and then to bond issues, and were usually equivalent to a partial conversionprivilege. They were unimportant in amount, and hence did noharm. Their use expanded in the late 1920s, along with many other financial abuses, but they dropped from sight for long years there- after",

Let us consider for a moment what is really involved in this financial setup. Ordinarily, a common-stock issue has the first rightto buy additional common shares when the companys directorsfind it desirable to raise capital in this manner.

Why then are these subscription warrants created as part of the originalcapital structure? Simply because people are inexpert in financial matters. They dont realize that the common stock is worth less with warrants outstanding than otherwise.

THE ZEAL OF THE CONVERT Although convertible bonds are called bonds,  they behave like stocks, work like options, and are cloaked in obscurity. If you own a convertible, you also hold an option: You can either keep the bond and continue to earn interest on it, or you canexchange it for common stock of the issuing company at a predeter- mined ratio. (An option gives its owner the right to buy or sell another security at a given price within a specific period of time.) Because theyare exchangeable into stock, convertibles pay lower rates of interestthan most comparable bonds.

It has defaulted on most of its bond issues, and has been in danger ofabandoning its operations entirely. Its security issues fell drasti-cally in price, the common stock collapsing from a high level of 86 12 as recently as 1968 to a low of 512in 1970. (There seems little doubt that these shares will be wiped out in reorganization.) Our basic point is that the application of the simplest rules of security analysis and the simplest standards of sound investmentwould have revealed the fundamental weakness of the Penn Cen- tral system long before its bankruptcycertainly in 1968, when theshares were selling at their post-1929 record, and when most of its bond issues could have been exchanged at even prices for well- secured public-utility obligations with the same coupon rates.

Thus the first effect of the deal was to reduceNVFs real equity from 17,400,000 to 2,200,000 or from 23.71 per share to about 3 per share, on 731,000 shares.

Final Chapter For the first half of 1970 the company reported a further loss of 1 million. It now had a good-sized capital deficit. It was kept out of bankruptcy by loans made by Mr. Williams, up to a total of2,500,000. No further statements seem to have been issued, until in January 1971 AAA Enterprises finally filed a petition in bank- ruptcy.

In each comparison weshall comment only on those aspects that have a special meaning and import.

But Realty Equities had been metamorphosed into something mon- strous and vulnerable. How did Wall Street react to these diverse developments?

The issues were selling atabout the same price, but because of Hills larger capitalization it was valued at about twice the total figure of the other. This differ- ence should appear somewhat surprising, since Edison had about50 higher sales and one-quarter larger net earnings. As a result, we find that the key ratiothe multiplier of earningswas more than twice as great for Hill as for Edison. This phenomenon seemsexplicable chiefly by the persistence of a strong enthusiasm andpartiality exhibited by the market toward shares of book-publishing companies, several of which had been introduced topublic trading in the later 1960s. Actually, by the end of 1968 it was evident that this enthusiasm had been overdone. The Hill shares had sold at 56 in 1967, morethan 40 times the just-reported record earnings for 1966.

The determination of the true market value of Generals common- stock capitalization presents an interesting problem for securityanalysts and has important implications for anyone interested in the stock on any basis more serious than outright gambling. The relatively small 4 12convertible preferred can be readily taken care of by assuming its conversion into common, when the latter sells at a suitable market level. This we have done in Table 18-7. But the warrants require different treatment. In calculating the full dilu-tion basis the company assumes exercise of all the warrants, and the application of the proceeds to the retirement of debt, plus use of the balance to buy in common at the market. These assumptionsactually produced virtually no effect on the earnings per share in calendar 1968which were reported as 1.51 both before and after allowance for dilution.

This simple technique of adding the market price of the warrants to that of the common has a radical effect on the showing of National General at the end of1968, as appears from the calculation in Table 18-7.

For on the one hand it has an extraordinarily large number of sub- sidiary companies (at least 24), making an astonishing variety ofproducts, but on the other hand the entire conglomeration adds upto mighty small potatoes by usual Wall Street standards. The earnings developments in Whiting are rather characteristic of our business concerns. The figures show steady and rather spec- tacular growth from 41 cents a share in 1960 to 3.63 in 1968. But they carried no assurance that such growth must continue indefi-nitely. The subsequent decline to only 1.77 for the 12 months ended January 1971 may have reflected nothing more than the slowing down of the general economy. But the stock price reactedin severe fashion, falling about 60 from its 1968 high (43 12) to the close of 1969",

It would be hard to justify that price statistically. Whiting had a relatively small decline, to 1634in 1970. (At that price it was selling at just about the current assets aloneavailable for the shares). Its earnings held at 1.85 per share to July 1971. In early 1971 the price advanced to 24 12, which seemed rea- sonable enough but no longer a bargain by our standards.

At that price,Yum!s stock was selling at just over nine times its earnings and only 73 of its revenues. 6 As Graham liked to say, in the short run the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine. Yahoo! won the short-term popularity contest. But in the end, its earnings that matterand Yahoo! barely had any. Once the market stopped voting andstarted weighing, the scales tipped toward Yum!

We have askedthem also to demand clear and satisfying explanations when the results appear to be worse than they should be, and to support movements to improve or remove clearly unproductive manage-ments. Shareholders are justified in raising questions as to the com- petence of the management when the results (1) are unsatisfactory in themselves, (2) are poorer than those obtained by other compa-nies that appear similarly situated, and (3) have resulted in an unsatisfactory market price of long duration.

In essence a stock dividend of this sort has the same over-all effect as the payment of an equivalent amount of cash out ofearnings when accompanied by the sale of additional shares of like total value to the shareholders. However, a straight stock dividend has an important tax advantage over the otherwise equivalentcombination of cash dividends with stock subscription rights, which is the almost standard practice for public-utility companies. The New York Stock Exchange has set the figure of 25 as a practical dividing line between stock splits and stock dividends.Those of 25 or more need not be accompanied by the transfer of their market value from earned surplus to capital, and so forth.Some companies, especially banks, still follow the old practice ofShareholders and Managements 493  Today, virtually all stock splits are carried out by a change in value",

The most plausible explanation for this decline is that corporate managers became uncomfortable with the idea that shareholders might interpret special dividends as a signal that future profits might be low. The academic criticism of dividends was led by Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani, whose influential article Dividend Policy, Growth, and the Valua- tion of Shares (1961) helped win them Nobel Prizes in Economics. Millerand Modigliani argued, in essence, that dividends were irrelevant, since aninvestor should not care whether his return comes through dividends and arising stock price, or through a rising stock price alone, so long as the totalreturn is the same in either case. www.fx1618.com",

And when Graham says that a 5 increase ina cash dividend on 100 shares is less probable than a constant dividend on 105 shares, its unclear how he could even calculate that probability.  Subscription rights, often simply known as rights,  are used less fre-quently than in Grahams day. They confer upon an existing shareholder the right to buy new shares, sometimes at a discount to market price. A share- holder who does not participate will end up owning proportionately less ofthe company. Thus, as is the case with so many other things that go by thename of rights,  some coercion is often involved.

That original section (The Investor as Business Owner) dealt with shareholders voting rights,ways of judging the quality of corporate management, and techniques for detecting conflicts of interest between insiders and outside investors. By his last revised edition, however, Graham had pared thewhole discussion back to less than eight terse pages about dividends.

Graham saw right through this managerial malarkey: A companys management may run the business well and yet not give the outside stockholders the right results for them, because its effi-ciency is confined to operations and does not extend to the best use of the capital. The objective of efficient operation is to produce at low cost and to find the most profitable articles to sell. Efficient finance requires that the stockholders money be working in forms most suit-able to their interest. This is a question in which management, as such, has little interest. Actually, it almost always wants as much capital fromthe owners as it can possibly get, in order to minimize its own financial problems. Thus the typical management will operate with more capital than necessary, if the stockholders permit itwhich they often do. 8 In the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, the managements of leading technology companies took this Daddy-Knows-Best attitude to new extremes",

That conversion of options to shares is called exercising the options. The employees can then sell the shares at the current marketprice and pocket the difference as profit. Because hundreds of millions of options may be exercised in a given year, the company must increase its supply of shares outstanding. Then, however, the companys total netincome would be spread across a much greater number of shares, reducing its earnings per share. Therefore, the company typically feels compelled to buy back other shares to cancel out the stock issued to the option holders.In 1998, 63.5 of chief financial officers admitted that counteracting thedilution from options was a major reason for repurchasing shares (see CFOForum, The Buyback Track,  Institutional Investor, July, 1998). www.fx1618.com",

In 1997 , SteveJobs, the cofounder of Apple Computer Inc., returned to the companyas its interim chief executive officer. Already a wealthy man, Jobsinsisted on taking a cash salary of 1 per year. At year-end 1999, to thank Jobs for serving as CEO for the previous 2 1/2 years without compensation,  the board presented him with his very own Gulfstreamjet, at a cost to the company of a mere 90 million. The next month Jobs agreed to drop interim from his job title, and the boardrewarded him with options on 20 million shares. (Until then, Jobs hadheld a grand total of two shares of Apple stock.)

      "text": ". Theory of Diversification There is a close logical connection between the concept of a safety margin and the principle of diversification. One is correla- tive with the other. Even with a margin in the investors favor, an individual security may work out badly. For the margin guaranteesonly that he has a better chance for profit than for lossnot that loss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is increased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of theprofits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple basis of the insurance-underwriting business. Diversification is an established tenet of conservative invest- ment. By accepting it so universally, investors are really demon-strating their acceptance of the margin-of-safety principle, to whichdiversification is the companion. This point may be made more col-orful by a reference to the arithmetic of roulette",

There is no guarantee that this fundamental quantitative approach will con- tinue to show favorable results under the unknown conditions ofthe future.

THE RISK IS NOT IN OUR STOCKS, BUT IN OURSELVES Risk exists in another dimension: inside you. If you overestimate how well you really understand an investment, or overstate your abilityto ride out a temporary plunge in prices, it doesnt matter what you own or how the market does. Ultimately, financial risk resides not in what kinds of investments you have, but in what kind of investor you are. If you want to know what risk really is, go to the nearest bathroomand step up to the mirror. Thats risk, gazing back at you from the glass. As you look at yourself in the mirror, what should you watch for?

But while the proba-bilities in Pascals wager are a toss-up, the consequences are per- fectly clear and utterly certain. As Bernstein explains: Suppose you act as though God is and [you] lead a life of virtue and abstinence, when in fact there is no god. You will have passed upsome goodies in life, but there will be rewards as well. Now suppose you act as though God is not and spend a life of sin, selfishness, and lust when in fact God is.

The probability of making at least one mistake atsome point in your investing lifetime is virtually 100, and those odds are entirely out of your control.

Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequentday the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called tenflips in a row. They each will have won a little over 1,000. Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be mod-est, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping. Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who, by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over 1 million",

The patriarch has merely set forth the intellectual theory for making coin-calling decisions, but each student has decided on his own manner of applying the theory. The common intellectual theme of the investors from Graham- and-Doddsville is this: they search for discrepancies between thevalue of a business and the price of small pieces of that business in the market. Essentially, they exploit those discrepancies withoutthe efficient market theorists concern as to whether the stocks arebought on Monday or Thursday, or whether it is January or July,etc",

The Washington Post experience does not cover a terribly long period but it does represent many investment decisions bythree managers who were not identified retroactively. Table 9 is the record of the FMC Corporation fund. I dont man- age a dime of it myself but I did, in 1974, influence their decision toselect value-oriented managers.

The net difference now between a median performance andthe actual performance of the FMC fund over this period is 243million. FMC attributes this to the mindset given to them about the selection of managers. Those managers are not the managers I would necessarily select but they have the common denominatorof selecting securities based on value. So these are nine records of coin-flippers from Graham-and- Doddsville. I havent selected them with hindsight from amongthousands.

I knew what they had been taught and additionally I had some personal knowledge of their intellect, character, and temperament. Its very important to understand thatthis group has assumed far less risk than average; note their record in years when the general market was weak. While they differ greatly in style, these investors are, mentally, always buying the business, not buying the stock. A few of them sometimes buy whole businesses. Far more often they simply buy small pieces of busi-nesses. Their attitude, whether buying all or a tiny piece of a busi-ness, is the same. Some of them hold portfolios with dozens of stocks; others concentrate on a handful. But all exploit the differ-ence between the market price of a business and its intrinsic value.

When the price of a stockcan be influenced by a herd on Wall Street with prices set at the margin by the most emotional person, or the greediest person, or the most depressed person, it is hard to argue that the marketalways prices rationally. In fact, market prices are frequently non-sensical. I would like to say one important thing about risk and reward. Sometimes risk and reward are correlated in a positive fashion.

If you buy a dol- lar bill for 60 cents, its riskier than if you buy a dollar bill for 40 cents, but the expectation of reward is greater in the latter case. The greater the potential for reward in the value portfolio, the less risk there is. One quick example: The Washington Post Company in 1973 was selling for 80 million in the market. At the time, that day, youcould have sold the assets to any one of ten buyers for not less than400 million, probably appreciably more.

And to people who think beta measures risk, the cheaper price would have made it look riskier. This is truly Alice in Wonderland.

And, as a matter of fact, if you buy a group of such securities and you know anything at all about business valuation, there isessentially no risk in buying 400 million for 80 million, particu- larly if you do it by buying ten 40 million piles for 8 million each.Since you dont have your hands on the 400 million, you want to be sure you are in with honest and reasonably competent people, but thats not a difficult job. You also have to have the knowledge to enable you to make a very general estimate about the value of the underlying businesses.But you do not cut it close. That is what Ben Graham meant by having a margin of safety. You dont try and buy businesses worth83 million for 80 million. You leave yourself an enormous mar-gin.

I can only tell you that the secret has been out for 50 years, ever since Ben Graham and Dave Dodd wroteSecurity Analysis, yet I have seen no trend toward value investing in the 35 years that Ive practiced it. There seems to be some per-verse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult.The academic world, if anything, has actually backed away from the teaching of value investing over the last 30 years. Its likely to continue that way. Ships will sail around the world but the FlatEarth Society will flourish.

My address today is an efforttoward such understanding in a limited fieldin particular, an endeavor to point out some contrasting relationships between the present and the past in our underlying attitudes toward invest-ment and speculation in common stocks.

It comes from the attitude and viewpoint of the stock-buying publicand their adviserschiefly us security analysts.

For one thing, it obliterates a good part of the older, well-established distinctions between investment andspeculation. The dictionary says that speculate comes from theLatin specula, a lookout. Thus it was the speculator who lookedout and saw future developments coming before other people did.But today, if the investor is shrewd or well advised, he too must have his lookout on the future, or rather he mounts into a common lookout where he rubs elbows with the speculator.

Thirdly, the concept of future prospects, and par-ticularly of continued growth in the future, invites the applicationof formulas out of higher mathematics to establish the present value of the favored issues. But the combination of precise formu- las with highly imprecise assumptions can be used to establish, orrather to justify, practically any value one wishes, however high, for a really outstanding issue. But, paradoxically, that very fact on close examination will be seen to imply that no one value, or rea-sonably narrow range of values, can be counted on to establish and maintain itself for a given growth company; hence at times the market may conceivably value the growth component at a strik-ingly lowfigure.

Let me illustrate briefly the old-time speculative common stock, as distinguished from an investment stock, by some datarelating to American Can and Pennsylvania Railroad in 19111913.

In those three years the price range of Pennsy moved only between 53 and 65, or between 12.2 and 15 times its average earn- ings for the period. It showed steady profits, was paying a reliable3 dividend, and investors were sure that it was backed by wellover its par of 50 in tangible assets.

Thus American Can common was a representativespeculative issue, because American Can Company was then a speculatively capitalized enterprise in a fluctuating and uncertain industry.

We set out to find the effect on revenues of a proposed revo-lutionary new system of computing express rates.

(You will find approximatelythese ratios in the initial offering of Woolworth preferred and com-mon stock in 1911, and in numerous others.) But what has hap- pened since the 1920s? Essentially the exact reverse of these relationships may now be seen. A company must now typicallyearn about 10 per cent on its common equity to have it sell in the average market at full book value.

Now there is a logical reason for this reversal in valuation proce- dure, which is related to the newer emphasis on growth expecta-tions. Companies that earn a high return on capital are given theseliberal appraisals not only because of the good profitability itself, and the relative stability associated with it, but perhaps even more cogently because high earnings on capital generally go hand inhand with a good growth record and prospects",

Thus what is reallypaid for nowadays in the case of highly profitable companies is notthe good will in the old and restricted sense of an established nameand a profitable business, but rather their assumed superior expec- tations of increased profits in the future. This brings me to one or two additional mathematical aspects of the new attitude toward common-stock valuations, which I shalltouch on merely in the form of brief suggestions. If, as many tests show, the earnings multiplier tends to increase with profitabilityi.e., as the rate of return on book value increasesthen the arith-metical consequence of this feature is that value tends to increasedirectly as the square of the earnings, but inversely the book value.

Of course it took a brash analyst in his middle twenties like myself to hit on so smug and presumptuous a title. But in one of the papers I made the casual statement that if a common stock is a good investment it is also a good speculation. For, reasoned I, if a common stock was so sound that it carried verylittle risk of loss it must ordinarily be so good as to possess excel- lent chances for future gains.

Then, of course, the pendulum swung to the other extreme,and we soon saw one of the most respected authorities declaring(in 1931) that no common stock could ever be an investment.

But some of you rememberthat the next year, 1947, which established an impressive new high for G.E.s per-share earnings, was marked also by an extraordinary fall in the price-earnings ratio. At its low of 32 (before the 3-for-1split) G.E. actually sold again at only 9 times its current earnings and its average price for the year was only about 10 times earnings.

I have no desire at all to be dogmatic on this point. All I can say is that it is not settled in my mind, and each of you must seek to settle it for yourself. But in my concluding remarks I can say something definite about the structure of the market for various types of commonstocks, in terms of their investment and speculative characteristics.In the old days the investment character of a common stock was more or less the same as, or proportionate with, that of the enter-prise itself, as measured quite well by its credit rating",
