      "text": "I FOREWORD f youre reading this book, it is because at some point, you have worried, or are currently worried, about money. Talking about money, even if you have it, is a curious taboo. We rarely have open and honest conversations about our spending and saving habits. People may boast about great investments, like the stock that made them super-sized returns, but shy away from mentioning the strain on their financial life caused by their expensive spending habits  like that fancy coffee they order twice a day. We worry about investment the way we worry about our weight. Instead of dieting or investing being a habit, we only think of them as remedial measures when our weight or our bank balance goes too high or too low. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the commission-driven world of finance has been deliberately obfuscated for the layman. Navigating through the jargon can feel like trying to cut through a dense thicket with a butter knife",

Which is why I appreciate Monikas new book. It wants us to start having honest conversations about money. This means admitting that our excuses are just that: excuses. Managing your finances is not a luxury for the rich, it is hygiene for everyone. I know Monika from her role as consulting editor at Mint . In our interactions, I was always struck by her focus on the consumer. She would ask all the hard questions about complex economic affairs and then work to communicate them simply to her audience. As you reach Chapter 6 you will learn why. Monika is not some prodigious financial genius, picking blockbuster investments since she was sixteen. In the true spirit of talking honestly about money, she humbly admits she started investing quite late, and also found it difficult to meet her saving goals in her early years",

Nor is it trying to sell you something. Unlike intermediaries who need to make themselves indispensable, Monika tries hard to make herself unnecessary after youve read the book. She doesnt just give you academic reasons for her advice, but also helpful analogies and relatable stories to explain why you should manage your finances in the way she prescribes. Her chapter on equity is full of delightful analogies that turn the intimidating task of portfolio selection into a much simpler task of choosing the right kind of vehicle for your needs. These examples are funny, but also revealing. The value of this book, then, is not in the technical details themselves. Monika summarizes them in less than half a page in every chapter",

The delight is in reading her personal stories, and those of her friends, to understand these concepts, instead of glossing over them next time someone starts talking about fixed-income products or equity-linked savings schemes. The other reason why Im excited by the launch of Lets Talk Money is its timing. If youre an investor, young or old, there is no better time for you to pick up this book than right now. India is in the middle of a digital transformation. Like I said in 2015, we are going through the WhatsApp moment of banking. What does that mean? Today you can open a bank account in less than a minute. With eKYC, it is not just some fancy new-age banks that let you open accounts instantly, but also the nationalized banks you have come to know and trust. Monika recommends three different bank accounts: Income, Spend-it and Invest-it. Today, thats a total of three minutes, versus three trips to the bank earlier",

Technology can also help you nudge your behaviour by increasing friction for areas of spending. There could be apps that ask you to enter two OTPs for that unnecessary e-commerce purchase.

We worry about ageing parents and their long-term care. But most of all we worry about emergencies and hoard cash.

It builds in safety nets for preserving your savings in the face of an emergency  typically a medical emergency, a job loss, or death of a salary-earning family member. Insurances have a purpose in a money box. Well understand what that purpose is. No, it is not wealth creation.

I dont know about you, but I have had this experience many times over: Whatever may be the amount of cash in the wallet or in the home cash box, it gets spent. Large chunks of unused money cry out to be used, and get borrowed away or spent on an impulse that later you wonder why you gave into.

I remember one relationship manager, of my salary account, calling me very upset at the money moving out so fast. Whys he upset  because the longer the money stays in the bank, the better he manages to meet his deposit target, or the target of getting a certain amount of deposits in the bank each month. Why does the bank want higher deposits? Because your money is lent out to others  loans earn the bank anywhere between 10 per cent to 18 per cent, while you get a 4 per cent interest on your savings deposit.

On the other extreme, if you are the sole earner of a house that has your spouse, kids and parents to support, along with an EMI to pay, youre better off having up to a years worth of spending in the emergency fund.

Set yourself a monthly target for your emergency fund and keep crediting your emergency account each month. Once you get to your target, stop funding it, and we are ready to move to more long-term investments. But before that, we need to secure the seat belt just a bit more  we need our insurances in place. This is the go-to fund when disaster strikes in the form of a job loss or death. Even if you have a life cover, the money takes time to come, but the ongoing costs dont stop. I cant stress the importance of this fund. It is the difference between slipping into disaster and staying afloat.

Sure, some of them are rich enough not to need a cover, but they said, it has been on their must-buy list, but they somehow never got around to it. What is a medical cover? Each time we go to the doctor for a viral fever, we dont really think of the cost too much. The fee is affordable because we choose our doctors given our own spending power. The prescription medicines he gives also dont break the monthly budget.

This transfer of the risk happens when you buy a medical insurance plan where, for the price of a premium, you buy a much larger cover or insurance. You get refunded for what you spend and do not get the entire cover you have. If you have a Rs 5-lakh cover policy and your hospital bill comes to Rs 2 lakhs, you should get a refund of Rs 2 lakhs. Getting a good medical cover is probably more important than buying life insurance  youre more likely to go to hospital with an illness or accident than die .

You can claim expenditure made on doctors fees, medicines and diagnostic tests done before a planned hospitalization and for three months afterwards. For example, a knee replacement will have MRI costs before the surgery and physiotherapy costs post surgery. Check if you can claim these costs. Check the exact amount and time your policy will cover. Seven, ask for a list of day-care procedures that dont need you to stay for twenty-four hours in a hospital any more . Procedures and treatment such as a cataract surgery or surgery for a ligament tear (there is a standard list of 130 such procedures) are treated as day-care procedures and are covered",

You know if a telecom service is good or not when you use it. It is very here and now, but for a medical policy, the moment of truth is when you file a claim. Does the insurer pay up? How much does he pay? Is the process easy? How quickly does the company respond to complaints? These are questions that you must think about at the time of buying your policy. Unfortunately, in India, claims data is not standardized and is difficult to get. The regulator has not thought the disclosure of data through so as to make it meaningful to consumers. Ask the agents these questions on claims before you buy. One, how many claims does the company settle? Out of 100, if the companys claims history does not settle more than ninety-five claims, dont buy from the firm. Claims are a tricky area because the companies club together group and individual claims data",

Be careful of firms that give data on complaints as a percentage of policies sold. What is relevant is how many people, how many made a claim, then how many went on to complain. This number should be low in the policy you finally choose. Yup, you need a degree in finance, law and patience to choose a mediclaim policy.

Insurance companies ideally want to insure supermen and superwomen who are in the best of health and wont ever make a claim. Some companies take their aversion to giving cover to people with a pre-existing ailment to ridiculous lengths. If you fall in this category and are not getting cover, there are still some things you can do. You can buy a policy with sub-limits, co-pay and an exclusion period for your existing ailment. Remember sub-limits are limits on what the policy will pay for certain diseases and for the room rent and related costs. A co-pay is what you agree to share with the company in terms of cost. An exclusion period is the waiting period before the policy will start paying a claim. These are restrictive, but better than not having a policy",

If you were planning to buy a Rs 5-lakh cover, target a Rs 10-lakh fund for your medical costs. If you dont need the fund and stay healthy, this is money that you will bequeath to your kids.

Yes, you do. A critical illness, like cancer, is a disease where you may not spend too much time in hospital but have very large out-of-pocket expenses.

You should be able to add a rider to your existing policy on the policy renewal date. A rider is an add-on at a very low cost to a basic policy. Riders look attractive, but I recommend that you buy a stand-alone accident policy from a general insurer.

When you die an untimely death you leave lots of things midway  it could be a meal, sleep, a conversation, a fight, a joke, a holiday plan. You also leave your family midway in their journey through life  both physically and financially. While we can work on leaving only good memories with our family by becoming the person we think we are, the financial piece is much easier to do. You need to figure out how much the family will need to live, without you bringing in the monthly income, and how much for the future of the kids education and marriage. You may have dependent parents and a spouse who does not earn, and may need to provide for them till they are alive as well",

The other big expense that will hit the family if you suddenly disappear is the debt you have. Home loans, car loans, education, personal loans, credit card debt  all of this will need to be paid back if you are to continue using what was bought with a loan. While there are few cases of a family getting thrown out of the house in India by a bank, do you really want that pressure on your family when the problem can be easily resolved? You need a life insurance cover to look after all of these expenses and costs if your lifeline is cut before time.

The way insurance has been sold in India, my guess is that you are sitting on a lot of dud policies. Why do I call them dud? Because they dont solve any of your financial problems. These are products not designed to give you either a good cover or a good return. In its purest form, a life insurance cover should pay your beneficiary a lump sum when you die for the price of the premium. If you outlive your policy, no money comes back.

An average thirty-five-year-old can buy a twenty-five-year term plan that gives his beneficiary Rs 1 crore (Rs 10 million) if he dies within those twenty-five years for the price of Rs 8,000 to 10,000 a year. Pull out your plans and see how much cover you have. I can assure you that if you dont have a term plan, you dont have much cover. You have a dud. Or many, many duds. Understanding life insurance products in the market In a term policy, your premium is a price you pay for buying a life cover.

The second, 3.98 per cent a year. Sometimes the pitch is even more complicated. I really do get the impression that the intention is to obfuscate and hide the real return of the product in fancy numbers. An easy way to cut through the tyranny of being hit by large numbers is to use the Rule of 72 . This is a versatile rule that we shall use many times in the book. To know the rate of return every year of a double-your-money proposition, simply ask the question: Over what time does my money double? Then divide 72 by that number.

Over the past fifteen years that I have tracked this industry, my team and I have decoded hundreds of these policies to find out what they finally return as a percentage of your investment. If we are smart enough to understand that an FD gives back an interest of 6 or 7 per cent, why then does an insurance policy hide this return so carefully? The reason is that they give you pathetic returns. On an average, a guaranteed return policy gives around 3 per cent annual return. What are called participating plans (or plans that give you a bonus at the end of the policy) give between 0.5 per cent to 4 per cent return. You read that correctly.

Lets not worry about jargon here, but just understand that the price of your pure life cover is calculated by keeping in mind, among other things, how long an average person lives, what the gender is and at what age they are today.

      "text": ". When term plans were launched online some years ago, the prices dropped by almost half! A policy sold by an agent costs twice as much as the policy you buy online. We changed our policies midway from an agent-bought-one to an online one some years back. We were older and we got more cover, but the online price was only a little over the price we were paying for the older policy. We let go of the old policy and bought a new one. Luckily, weve not used it. And hope that money gets wasted and goes down the drain . Rule Two: When buying a term cover, check the claims experience of the insurance firm . Shortlist three or four policies that you like in terms of low prices for your age, cover and tenure, and then start looking at the claims experience. This is not so easy to find. A claims experience of over 95 per cent is fine. This means that the company pays 95 per cent of the claims filed. Do a simple google search on this metric to see which firms show up",

What do we mean by safe? Will they run away with our money? No, they wont. We have a regulator in place that sets the rules of the game. These rules say that any insurance company needs to have enough money to be solvent. Will the insurance company be around twenty years later? Well, some of them have already been in the business for the last fifteen years and will be around in the future as well. If a company wants to get out of the insurance business, it will sell its shares to another company or get taken over. So,",

When you dont need to go to work to pay your bills, EMI, fees and other living costs. Your investments are large enough to look after all your expenses  current and future. Most people reach this milestone around the age of sixty, when they retire. Retirement either comes with a pension or a lump sum that is invested to harvest an income. But suppose you get very rich midway. Maybe you cash out the business you own and plan to just invest that money and not work any more, or you inherit a large estate from your parents that takes care of all your financial needs. When that happens, you dont need a life cover. What if you die? The same corpus will look after the family.

A big reason why people stay in fixed deposits, gold, insurance and real estate is the fear of making errors. Weve grown up with FDs, land, insurance plans and gold as the holy grail of investment. Moving away from these into other financial products, such as mutual funds, means getting out of our comfort zone  and that is always scary.

The core of the product is a loan. When you make a deposit with the bank, it treats it as a loan from you. And needs to give a periodic return, and then the principal back to you after an agreed upon time. These are products where two things are fixed  how much you will get back and when you will get it back.

They are offering a higher interest as a sweetener for the higher risk you take. You must remember this each time you are offered a company deposit or a scheme that offers you very high interest rates.

What is the role of gold, why should it occupy a place in our money box at all? Ideally gold is good as a hedge against inflation. This means that the price of gold rises over the years, so that your money does not lose purchasing power. Gold does not give an interest like your bank deposit. It does not throw off dividend like a stock. Nor does it give rent, like your property. The only way you can profit from gold is when its value goes up  when you actually make a profit.

If you bought ten years ago, your return is around 9 per cent per year. Remember these are bullion prices. If you bought jewellery thinking you are making an investment, the numbers in the table above are all much lower. You lose 30 per cent straightaway to making charges when you buy gold as jewellery. No, Im not saying no to jewellery. I enjoy my own gold trinkets, but Im sure that these are not part of my investments at all. I buy jewellery because I enjoy wearing or gifting it. For my investments, I stay with mutual funds. But the funds discussion needs to wait. We need to understand that every investment we make has costs  some we can see, others we cannot or prefer not to  like the making charges for gold jewellery",

Few people actually sell gold jewellery to bring home the profit; it is usually gifted one generation to the next. So buying gold jewellery as investment just does not make sense. There are other ways to hold gold. Given the role of gold in our families and the need to gift gold at weddings in India, do buy gold. But buy it sensibly. Not more than 510 per cent of your total portfolio goes into gold. You do not buy jewellery as investment . Your options to buy gold are coins, bars, gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and gold bonds from the government. As of 2017, the smart investment decision is to buy the bonds",

The reason people think real estate is a great investment is that they look at the return in absolute terms, from point to point. The flat that sold for Rs 1 crore was bought for just ten lakhs, is something weve heard so often. Lost in this conversation is the fact that the distance between the buying and selling price is twenty-seven years, costs of maintenance, property taxes, brokerage and insurance.

Most of the second sales in real estate take place in cash, and dealing in black is like a treadmill  once you get on it, you have to keep running with the money. The habit of black money is so strong that we cannot even imagine a situation where a cash component is the exception and a full cheque payment is the norm.

The rules are that each shop must have a registration number, must maintain some cleanliness, must obey the market-closing time, must provide an hour of lunch break for employees, and so on. Only shopkeepers that stick to rules can open a store. A stock market also has some rules that firms that want to be listed must obey.

Yes, Im sure haphus is there in the index. With me so far? OK, now, the prices of some items in the index will go up and the prices of some things will go down. For example, the price of a telephone call has fallen sharply over the last ten years, but the price of dal has more than tripled. Ups and downs in price will cancel each other out, but if price rises on the average have been more than the price falls, the index will rise  and we will say inflation",

Over a thirty-year period, this difference in cost will be significant if your managed fund does not beat the index by more than the cost difference. Four, do not invest in any product that locks you into a particular company or asset manager. What we forget is that, over the long term in equity investing, the risk is not of the market, but of poor fund management. This is why I do not recommend having a ULIP in your equity portfolio, despite it being competitive with mutual funds in terms of costs. A ULIP will lock you in with a particular companys asset management and shuffling is expensive. What you want is a product where exit is possible, cheap and easy. Think of it as portability you should be able to port your money to a better fund manager for a very tiny cost, if you are unhappy with the existing one.

Some smart investors run their funds past all the three metrics to see if they pass the test. Take a considered decision that you can own. Not investing in equity is not an option. You may as well understand the road rules of investing. Also, remember that we created an emergency fund and bought medical and life covers so that you can put your money to work for the long term. Weve taken away the need for keeping money liquid and building a safety net under your money box. Your money box can take the risk that equity brings in the short term now.

You will buy bonds of one or two or maybe three firms. A mutual fund will hold bonds of at least twenty-five to thirty firms. If one of your three bonds does badly, you lose one-third of your portfolio. If the same bond is held by your mutual fund, the hit on your money will be a fraction, since the fund is holding many other bonds. This is called diversification  we reduce our risk by increasing the number of products we hold . Instead of bonds, our job will then be to choose the right experts from all the mutual funds in the market. And yes, there is a way to do that. But more of that later.

It is usually safe to stay with large funds from large well-known fund houses. If you cannot understand this yourself, you definitely need to work with a financial planner, or read more. Other types of debt fund There are other categories of debt funds  corporate bond fund, medium-term bond funds, credit risk funds, long-term bond fund, G-Sec funds and monthly income plans (MIPs).

Once you understand mutual funds better, you can switch out of debt funds for cash needs beyond one year or one-and-a-half years and buy balanced funds too.

We now know that the Sensex has thirty stocks. How many of each is held depends on a formula. So the number of shares of each of the thirty shares that will be bought will depend on the weight of the share in the index. If we were thinking of a mango price index, wed include all thirty varieties, and give a higher weight to the kind that sells more.

An ETF also tracks an index like the Sensex but lists its units on a stock exchange, unlike a mutual fund. To buy and sell mutual funds you dont need to have a demat account.

So the risk of a mid- cap index fund is much higher than the risk involved with a Sensex or Nifty fund. Another way to classify equity mutual funds is by looking at them through the lens of market cap. At the very basic level there are three kinds of equity funds  large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap funds. Large-cap funds are more mature and stable, since they invest in the larger companies that are listed in the stock market. A mid-cap fund invests in stocks of mid-sized firms.

These schemes allow you to invest in stocks of a particular sector  technology, banking, pharma, FMCG and retail. Then there are thematic funds that track a bunch of sectors. For instance, the infrastructure theme will include sectors such as construction, telecom, power and so on. So a sector fund is a narrower cut of the market; a thematic fund a broader cut.

It will do your financial health a whole lot of good to just understand the terms the Suits throw at you. Growth or dividend There are three kinds of options that each mutual fund scheme offers you: growth, dividend and dividend reinvestment. The growth option allows you to stay invested and get the benefit of long-term growth of the portfolio. Your profits are not realized, or in other words, your profits reflect in the rising price, much like a stock price that goes up. Till you sell, the profit is unrealized or notional. The growth option works especially well for equity funds as it allows you to keep the money invested in the market. The profit your fund makes remains in the market and you get the benefit of compounding over the years. The number of units you buy remain the same, but the price, or the NAV, keeps going up",

Obviously for the same scheme, the NAV of a growth option will be higher than the dividend option. This option is good for those who need a periodic income from their investments, like the retired do. The dividend reinvestment option is a strange animal that wants growth but is afraid of not booking profits. A legacy of the past, the dividend reinvestment option is unique to India. What happens is this: Profits are booked, but instead of declaring a dividend, the fund house buys more units at the current price. So your number of units goes up but the NAV remains near the dividend option NAV. In effect you have the growth option corpus. This is a good option for some tax manoeuvring in debt funds.

You know that if you contribute to certain products, like the premium of a life insurance policy, or the public provident fund (PPF), or units of an ELSS scheme, you get a deduction from your taxable income. In June 2018, the benefit was Rs 1.5 lakhs. An ELSS is an equity fund that gets this tax benefit. It has a three-year lock-in period, and you cannot exit before that. Remember not to tick the dividend or dividend reinvestment option in an ELSS. Go for growth. Work out why that is a good idea. Balanced funds As the name suggests a balanced fund is a hybrid.

Balanced funds are a great first investment to make in order to taste equity funds. There are many other kinds of funds in the market. For a beginner, the discussion here is enough. Maybe Ill write a book just on mutual funds and dive deeper into all there is to know about smart investing in funds. NAV What is this NAV? It is the price of a unit of a scheme.

This will be shared equally by the units, but before that costs will be removed. If the cost is Rs 10,000, the profit that goes to the unit holders is Rs 40,000. This gets reflected in the NAV that goes from Rs 10 to Rs 14. Your 100 units are now worth Rs 1,400. Multiply the NAV with the number of units you hold to get the value of your mutual fund holding per scheme. How do mutual funds make money? Good question. Nobody is doing charity here.

Two, an ongoing cost or the annual fees that you need to pay to have experts manage your money. To take care of the running costs and profits of investment managers each year, some fees are deducted from your money. The cost to you of handing over your money to professionals is captured in a number called the expense ratio. This is the fees that a mutual fund charges investors for its costs and the profits it makes. The market regulator has put ceilings on how much a fund can charge you. This charge varies across fund categories. For example, a liquid fund may charge as little as 14 paise to Re 1 for every Rs 100 invested every year. Debt funds charge more, and it typically varies from 25 paise to Rs 1.5 on every Rs 100 in the scheme",

One, we usually earn a fixed amount each month and have a monthly surplus left over after expenses. An SIP is a good way to soak up the savings each month. Some people make a target for saving in an SIP and then spend the rest. They make SIP investments a target rather than a residue. An SIP matches the earning rhythm of most people and is very useful in building the habit of regular investment. Two, an SIP allows you to average out your price as you invest over the year, either monthly, or fortnightly, or even quarterly.

Commissions in investment products encourage sellers to maximize their income rather than your financial well-being. Therefore you need to choose products with zero or very tiny front costs. Ongoing costs over a long period also will cost you a lot. For example, the difference of just 1 percentage point in costs can reduce your final corpus by more than 25 per cent over a forty-year period.

As you get more used to the cash flow system, you can use just two. Your salary account is your income account where all inflows drop. The Spend-it account can be a joint account with your partner or parent or child  whoever shares the routine household expenses with you. It is a good idea for both partners to contribute to running of the house. It is usual for a woman to use her salary to run the house and the man his to build the assets. Unfortunately, in a divorce situation, the law awards assets to the person that paid for them. So share the routine expenses and build assets in both names. The third account is the Invest-it account into which you move either the",

And did we ever imagine that the Rs 50 we paid for a doctors consultancy fee two decades away will balloon to Rs 1,500 in a five-star corporate hospital? Inflation is relentless, and even when the rate of inflation falls it does not mean that prices go down. They just rise more slowly. Getting the right amount for retirement is a tough nut to crack.

The capital will be left as inheritance to the kids, along with the house and other assets. Given our own cultural background, how do we plan for our retirements? How do we know that were on track?

By age fifty, if you really have not a single rupee saved, you must salt away 80 per cent of your post-tax income.

What to do when products change You should replace a product from your money box with a new one in the market only if it is a better product in itself, or the replacement is made necessary due to changes in your circumstances. A better product is either cheaper or gives better benefits or both . If you invest in managed funds, and not ETFs and index funds, you need to check if the funds you have chosen are still good. Sometimes fund houses lose steam, they get sold, fund managers leave, or have a series of bad years. Managed funds mean that you have to track the funds in your money box.

Rising too hard, or falling too fast  most of us get influenced by the herd mentality and want to sell when the stock markets are crashing and want to buy more when they are rising. I recently got a mail from a family friend who wanted to invest some money for his father, sisters and himself. He works with a planner who had recommended balanced mutual funds, given the profile of the people and the sharp rise of markets beyond valuation at that point. It was a lump-sum investment and the planner, rightly, did not want his client to take home the risk of a sudden drop in prices immediately post investment. My friend wrote to me to say that his family wanted to take more risk than what the planner was recommending, and ask what he should do",

A rising market changes the nature of the asset allocation you said you were comfortable with. If the thought of 50:50 allocation in equity and debt looked good to you when markets were low, why should that change when markets are high? If the rise in markets changes your allocation ratio to 60:40, you need to rebalance; that is, sell equity and buy more debt funds or bonds to go back to the 50:50 allocation. In falling markets, the opposite is true. Why will you sell when the price is down? Thats the time to buy more to get your allocation back to the level you said you wanted. Be careful that market frenzies and sulks dont sweep you off your feet. It is usually a good idea to open the box once a year to evaluate if it needs a change .

Why make a will, my assets will go to my family If you die without a will, your house, gold, car, mutual funds, jewellery will go to your legal heirs. Who the legal heirs are depend on your religion in India and which personal law applies to you. For example, if you are a Hindu, and die intestate (without a will), your assets will be divided equally among Class 1 heirs. There is a list of twelve relations that fall in this category, including sons, daughters, surviving spouse and mother. Things get complicated when there are joint assets in the extended family, especially in real estate. Just writing down how you want your assets to be distributed solves a lot of the post-death trauma to the family. Second-guessing what you wanted to do after you are gone is an unfair burden you place on your family. Why make a will, my kids wont fight over my assets There was a man who said this.

Its always a good idea to put down details like passwords to online bank accounts in a password-protected dynamic Excel sheet. Put down in writing the location of property papers and locker keys. Once the details are done, indicate who should get what. For example, if you have two flats and want to leave one to each kid, do specify which one goes to whom. If there is jewellery, mention who gets what. Maybe take pictures and specify who gets what. Dont forget to include ownership of social media accounts, email addresses, intellectual property rights.

And as long as you keep paying back before the last date, you are good, but if you begin to fall behind on payments, the possibility of getting into a debt trap are very real. I was teaching a bunch of budding business journalists at the Asian College of Journalism in Chennai in 2017 and I asked what the cost of default on a credit card payment is. One person raised his hand and said it cost about 18 per cent. Do you know how much interest you pay if you dont pay your card bill on time? It can vary between 24 per cent and 36 per cent. Do you remember what your savings deposit gives you? 4 per cent. Your FD gives you a 6.5 per cent return, a debt fund about 89 per cent, and equity fund about 1215 per cent (over the long term). This is the cost of borrowing on your credit card",

For most people, the birth of a child is that sobering moment after which the relationship with money changes for good. But is there a way to be young and restless and yet not destroy your money box? Yes, there is. Use the cash flow system I described earlier to start saving a bit of money. Dont wait for the time when you have money to save. You never will. Nobody ever has enough money to start saving. Save a thousand bucks if you can, but make a start. The other thing to do is to begin making choices between need and greed. When you walk into the mall, the stuff on display, the smells, the lights, the sounds, the whole energy is screaming: spend, spend, spend.

Some people have overnight become really rich by buying bitcoins in the last few years. A bitcoin is one kind of cryptocurrency. What this means very simply is that, unlike physical currencies like the dollar or the rupee, no government issues cryptocurrency.

Ill list them out, and if you feel something is too large or too small, you can tweak the final rule of thumb accordingly. Assumption one: Your income will grow every year at 10 per cent. This is a reasonable assumption, because even if you dont get a 10 per cent increment each year, the salary jump whenever you change a job compensates for two years of flat raises. Assumption two: Your current expenditure and inflation grow at 6 per cent. Ive overstated inflation here because of our past experience with inflation.

The current government is prudent and, in 2018, is committed to an inflation target of 4 per cent with a plus-or-minus band of 2 per cent, which means that the central bank will target inflation between 2 per cent and 6 per cent, but will aim to keep it near 4 per cent. But this can change very quickly with a less responsible government; therefore, Im taking a 6 per cent number. Assumption three: Your investments grow at a conservative 10 per cent a year while you are working. In a 6 per cent inflation regime, the risk-free return, or return from products like the PPF or EPF, is usually 1 or 2 percentage points higher than inflation. It is reasonable to assume a risk-free return of 8 per cent. But you have some equity-linked products in your portfolio that will grow over the long term at about 12 per cent.

After you read this book and understand how equity investing works, Im hoping that you can target a return that is much higher than 10 per cent. If you do that, your savings ratio goes down. But lets stay conservative. Notice that in this system, you dont consume all of your annual salary hike. Salary grows at 10 per cent but expenses grow at 6 per cent. This difference between your salary hike and spending is what you will save for the rest of your goals. Too theoretical? So, lets say you are thirty years old, and earn Rs 6 lakhs post tax a year.

Now, your expense at age sixty-one will grow at 6 per cent a year, and each year you need more and more income just to retain your purchasing power. So by age sixty-five, you will need about Rs 21 lakhs a year or almost Rs 2 lakhs a month. By age seventy-five, you need just over Rs 3 lakhs a month. By age ninety, you need almost Rs 8 lakhs a month. If these numbers sound bizarre, just listen in to the really old people chatting in the park or at family dos, and you will hear the complaint against inflation. As a kid I remember getting irritated whenever the old people would get together. Now theyll start talking about how expensive everything is, I used to mutter.

      "text": "NOTES 5 What if You Die?  India had the traditional version of a life insurance policy till 2001, where you bought a money-back or endowment policy. Once the insurance industry opened up to private firms, a new market-linked version was introduced called a unit-linked insurance plan. This kind of an insurance plan gives the option to the investor to invest in stocks or bonds, or a combination of both. The fat commission for a first-time sale and a booming stock market gave rise to the big ULIP scam in India. 7 Lets De-Jargon Investing  The Suits use underlying all the time to confuse people; all it means is the product in which the investment is made. So in an equity mutual fund, the underlying is stocks. 10 Putting It All Together  You have been churned when an insurance agent makes you stop funding an old policy and sells you a new one. He has already harvested the high first-year commission on the old policy and will now harvest the commission on the new one",

It was very peaceful, made even more calm post a visit to the Matrimandir. Suddenly a man walked up and said: Monika Halan herself! We all looked up a bit shocked at this abrupt comment. Six heads turned to look at him. He then spoke further. You are the reason I am here. It seems that he had called on my NDTV show, asking if he could retire early. Hed sent his portfolio and his pension amounts. A bell rang in my head and I said, Youre the army guy! I remembered telling an army officer who wanted to take early retirement that his money was enough to go free. And here he was. In Auroville, living his dream life.

The goal is empowerment and financial freedom and not being suddenly super rich. Financial freedom and a feeling of being in control can happen even when you are not super rich. Those who peddle dreams of making you rich, giving you the secret to becoming wealthy overnight, are pressing very old buttons. These buttons are greed and exclusivity.
